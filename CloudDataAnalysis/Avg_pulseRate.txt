% Template MATLAB code for reading data from a private channel, analyzing
% the data and storing the analyzed data in another channel.

% Prior to running this MATLAB code template, assign the channel ID to read
% data from to the 'readChannelID' variable. Since this is a private
% channel, also assign the read API Key to the 'readAPIKey' variable. You
% can find the read API Key in the right side pane of this page.

% To store the analyzed data, you will need to write it to a channel other
% than the one you are reading data from. Assign this channel ID to the
% 'writeChannelID' variable. Also assign the write API Key to the
% 'writeAPIKey' variable below. You can find the write API Key in the right
% side pane of this page.

% TODO - Replace the [] with channel ID to read data from:
readChannelID = [717389];
% TODO - Enter the Read API Key between the '' below:
readAPIKey = 'F8KJIH2EOIQM1B97';

% TODO - Replace the [] with channel ID to write data to:
writeChannelID = [717729];
% TODO - Enter the Write API Key between the '' below:
writeAPIKey = 'A1N6SAXA1ZI3GKKE';

%% Read Data %%
data = thingSpeakRead(readChannelID, 'ReadKey', readAPIKey,'Fields',3,'NumMinutes',60);
%% Analyze Data %%
data=data(~isnan(data));
data=data(~isinf(data));
display(data);
avgHumidity=mean(data);
% Add code in this section to analyze data and store the result in the
% analyzedData variable.
analyzedData = avgHumidity;
display(analyzedData);
%% Write Data %%
thingSpeakWrite(writeChannelID,'Fields',3,'values', analyzedData, 'WriteKey', writeAPIKey);
